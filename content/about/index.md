Growing up in a small Vietnamese town with limited resources, I soon recognized my mom's struggle with her small business and fueled myself with the idea of entrepreneurship. I have been carrying along a mission to amplify my entrepreneurial impacts, providing resources to underserved places like my hometown. As early as I recognize product development as the backbone of any business, I started developing an affinity towards solving user problems using technology innovations and creating business opportunities. I love to dig into customer problems and solve them with modern technology.
 

I am a graduating senior at Johns Hopkins University major in Computer Science and Economics, where I have been capitalized on every exposure to product building. I have functioned as a team leader for tech and design teams. Having experience in different industries like Agriculture, Private Equity Consulting and Software, and hands-on opportunities on various technical projects, I am always open to product management and consulting opportunities where I can create business value and drive product impact.
